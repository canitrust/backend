# CanITrust.in

## What is CanITrust.in?
Browsers nowadays have a lot of built-in security features to help make the web more safe by default. Although this is a great thing, unfortunately, different browsers implement these features slightly different than other browsers. And sometimes, the implementations also differ from browser version to browser version.

This is where CanITrust.in comes to the rescue. Inspired by the great [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com), we built an environment to test all those different security features. This web site makes the results available.
