### Introduction
[Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) are key-value pairs which the server can set in the calling browser, like so:
``` 
Set-Cookie: foo=bar; secure
```
In the above example, the server sets the cookie ``foo`` with the value ``bar`` and sets the secure flag. This flag prevents the browser from sending this cookie to web sites which are not being called via HTTPS and therefore prevents the cookie from being sent unencrypted. This is an important security function to mitigate [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

If a request is made to a server, the browser will automatically send all cookies stored for this [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin). This is particularly useful for [session management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#cookies) where cookies will be used to store session identifiers (session IDs). This behaviour makes such session cookies highly security relevant.

### Problem
Since the secure flag prevents browsers from sending the respective cookie to non-HTTPS sites it should also not be possible for such sites to set secure cookies. Imagine the server sends the following HTTP headers when calling ``http://www.canitrust.in`` (note the ``http://`` part):
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
Set-Cookie: foo=bar; secure
[...]
```
In this example, the web site tries to set the cookie ``foo`` with the value ``bar`` and with the ``secure`` flag set. The browser should not accept this cookie as the site was loaded from a non-HTTPS server (``http://www.canitrust.in``).

### How does the browser react?
When the browser receives a ``Set-Cookie`` header with the ``secure`` flag set from a non-HTTPS site, the following results are possible:

1. The browser does not allow setting secure cookies for sites loaded from a non-HTTPS URL. The cookie declaration is ignored. This is the correct and safe implementation.
2. The browser allows setting secure cookies by non-HTTPS sites. This could lead to security vulnerabilities and should be avoided.
3. The browser accepts the secure cookie from a non-HTTPS site, but stores it without the ``secure`` flag. This is even more dangerous than the second option.

This testcase tests which browser chooses which of these options.
