### Introduction
The [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) or CSP allows a web application to give detailed instructions to the browser about how to handle its content. This usually happens with an HTTP header like:
``` 
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors www.canitrust.in
```
The above example tells the browser to not render the content of this site in frames or iframes unless they are loaded from ``www.canitrust.in``.

With the [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) HTTP header a very similar thing can be achieved:
```
X-Frame-Options: deny
```
This header tells the browser to never render the content of this page in a frame or an iframe. If both headers are present the browser should only accept the ``Content-Security-Policy`` header as it [obsoletes](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#frame-ancestors-and-frame-options) the ``X-Frame-Options`` header.

### Problem
Imagine the following HTML code being sent by the server when requesting ``http://www.canitrust.in``:
```
<html>
  <head>[...]</head>
  <body>
    [...]
    <iframe src="http://foo.canitrust.in/index.html" ></iframe>
    [...]
  </body>
</html
```
Now, the browser automatically sends a request to ``http://foo.canitrust.in/index.html`` to load the iframe and receives the following HTTP header:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors www.canitrust.in
X-Frame-Options: deny
[...]
```
In this example, the server sets both the ``Content-Security-Policy`` and the ``X-Frame-Options`` header and their values contradict each other in this case. The ``Content-Security-Policy`` allows the content to be loaded in iframes from within ``www.canitrust.in``, but the ``X-Frame-Options`` disallows the content to be loaded from any origin.

### How does the browser react?
When the browser receives such contradicting HTTP headers when loading the content of an iframe, it has the following two options:

1. Only accept the ``Content-Security-Policy`` header and disregard the ``X-Frame-Options`` header. This is the correct option as it is compliant to the [standard specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#frame-ancestors-and-frame-options).
2. Only accept the ``X-Frame-Options`` header and disregard the ``Content-Security-Policy`` header.

This testcase tests which browser chooses which of these options.
