### Introduction
HTML pages can load [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) images and display them. SVG images [can contain JavaScript](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/script.html) code to create animations or make the description of the image easier.

SVGs can be loaded in [different ways](https://vecta.io/blog/best-way-to-embed-svg) in the HTML, e.g. through an ``<img>`` tag:
``` 
<html>
  <head>[...]</head>
  <body>
    <img src="https://static.canitrust.in/cute-cat.svg"/>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Problem
If a web page loads an SVG through an ``<img>`` tag as shown above, the SVG could contain JavaScript code that tries to access the content of the loading page like so:
```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    setTimeout(function(){with(document)body.appendChild(createElement('p')).innerHTML = "Attack"},500)
  </script>
</svg>
```
The above SVG tries to access the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) and add an element to it. For security reasons the document object of the SVG should be different from that of the surrounding HTML page and therefore not accessible from the JavaScript code inside the SVG. If this would be possible, lots of different attacks from malicious SVGs would be possible against containing websites. This testcase tests whether this is possible.

### How does the browser react?
When loading an SVG in an ``<img>`` tag that contains JavaScript, the following things can happen:

1. The browser does not allow JavaScript code inside an SVG to access the DOM of the surrounding page and therefore does not allow changeing web page content. This is the secure and correct option.
2. The browser does allow JavaScript inside an SVG image to access and manipulate the DOM of the surrounding page. This would be a vulnerable implementation.

This testcase tests which browser chooses which of the these options.
