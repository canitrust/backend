### Introduction
The ``SameSite`` directive of cookies lets servers require that a cookie shouldn't be sent with cross-site requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF). Below is an example:
```
Set-Cookie: key=value; SameSite=Strict
```
The ``SameSite`` directive can be set to one of these three values:
* **None**: The browser will send cookies with both cross-site requests and same-site requests.
* **Strict**: The browser will not send cookies with cross-site requests.
* **Lax**: The browser will only send cookies with cross-site requests if the request is classified as a "top-level navigation" request, eg. by following a link.

### The test
This testcase verifies the support of browsers for the cookie's ``SameSite`` directive. The **Strict** value of the ``SameSite`` directive was used for the test, and the cross-site request was triggered by an embedded iframe.
