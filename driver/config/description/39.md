### Introduction
In order to introduce the topic, two main concepts must be explained first:

1) **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a technique specified in HTML5 to allows the circumvention of the Same-Origin policy. It is possible to send XHR requests to other domains from a given website and embed the subsequent response.

The CORS access is granted by the webserver which has been queried. The webserver sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header attribute stating that the browser is allowed to perform Cross-Origin requests on the webserver and obtain the requested response.

If the attribute is set with value `` ‘*’ ``, access to the web page of the web server may be performed from all domains. This entails that there are no restrictions to protect contents via CORS access. However, there is an exception to this rule: Whenever the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials-Header indicates, that it is allowed to access a resource with credentials (i.e. cookies or Credentials in an Authorization Header), the value of ``‘*’`` is not allowed.

The following examples show some capabilities of the CORS-Headers:

```
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Domain1.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Custom-Header
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,PUT,OPTIONS
```

2) **Caching** is a technique to locally store already retrieved server responses to serve the content when the user requests the same resource again. This reduces the network load and enhances the user experience with respect to page loading speeds. The server can specify how the browser should handle the cached response by setting the **Cache-Control**-Header. There is a variety of values this header can be served with. The following list shows some common one:

```
    Cache-Control: must-revalidate   //check status of resource before reusing
    Cache-Control: no-store          //cache does not store client-reuest or server-response

    Cache-Control: public            //every hop is allowed to cache
    Cache-Control: private           //only for one user, no shared cache is allowed to store it

    Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds> //time to use, relative to request timestamp
```
In addition, the **Vary**-Header controls, which keys may be used as a cache key in addition to the host / url. The Browser is responsible for handling the different directives in the resilient way.


### Problem
The following diagram describes a possible remote attack scenario, where potentially sensitive information in the browser cache can be leaked to a third party under certain circumstances.

![Browser cache leak](/assets/browser-cache-leak.png)
Imagine there is an API, residing on domain-A (www.good.com), which responds with secret data. Further assume a user logs into the website, also residing on domain-A, and gets an authentication identifier (cookie / token) set. This website fetches data from the API with e.g. the following request: ``fetch('https://www.good.com/sensitive_data').then([…])`` (see no. 1 in the picture above). Since this is not a cross-origin request and the required authentication is provided, the user is allowed to read the APIs response. Subsequently, the response is exposed to the front end.

Imagine the API omits the Cache-Control header. Therefore the browser caches the response in order to reduce network loads for further requests (see no. 3).

Further imagine this API is (mis-)configured with an ``'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'`` header and the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header is not set (see no. 2 in the above picture). Thus, and due to the required authentication, the browser forbids to read the response of this API, if it is called from another origin. Therefore, if the same JavaScript-code which is displayed above is used in a cross-origin context (e.g. by an attacker), the browser will raise an exception and deny the calling origin to read the response.

However, a special case happens if the original response from the request (no. 2) is already in the browser cache (no. 3). Within the ``fetch`` call, it is possible to force the usage of the browser cache. Therefore, an attacker may ask the browser to issue the first request but only look-up the cached contents (no. 4 in the above picture). The respecting code is listed in the following:

```
    fetch('https://www.good.com/sensitive_data',
        {
            'cache':'force-cache',
        }).then([…])
```

Note, that the JavaScript listing does **not** ask the browser to issue the request using any credentials.

### How does the browser react?

Option 1 (insecure): The browser serves the cached response and possibly leaks secret data. This obviously means, that the browser didn't included the existence of authorization data within its browser cache. (Note, that an existing ``Vary`` Header mitigates the attack.)

Option 2 (secure): The browser initiates a new request to the API and does not show the response.

The problem was first described [in this blogpost](https://enumerated.wordpress.com/2019/12/24/sop-bypass-via-browser-cache/). The author of the post describes it as a implementation error of the website. However, the origin of the vulnerability is that the usage of the authentication credentials is forgot when the cache is retrieved.
