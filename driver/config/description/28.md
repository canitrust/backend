### Introduction
Some browsers offer a feature called XSS Auditor (Chrome, Safari) or [XSS Filter](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-iv-the-xss-filter/) (Internet Explorer, Edge) which is intended to offer the user some basic protection against [reflected Cross-site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) attacks. These protection mechanisms have a default setting in the browser but can also be controlled by the server by setting the following HTTP header:
``` 
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```
In the above example, the server tells the browsers supporting this feature to switch XSS protection on (by setting the value to ``1``) and also to block loading the page in case an XSS attack is detected (with ``mode=block``). Other potential values for this header are:
``` 
X-XSS-Protection: 0
X-XSS-Protection: 1
```
With these, value ``0`` instructs the browser to turn off the protection and value ``1`` without ``mode=block`` instructs the browser to filter the identified attack payload instead of blocking the request.

The protection offered by this feature is rather limited and must therefore not be considered an adequate protection against XSS attacks. Also, browsers which do not support this feature (Firefox, Opera, etc.) will just ignore the header.

### Problem
Ever since the XSS protection features were introduced, researchers have been finding [ways around the protection](https://github.com/EdOverflow/bugbounty-cheatsheet/blob/master/cheatsheets/xss.md) or even [XSS](http://p42.us/ie8xss/Abusing_IE8s_XSS_Filters.pdf) that was only possible due to the XSS Filter. Google and Microsoft have been struggling to keep up up with these vulnerabilities.

More recently, researchers have found more attacks that are only possible because of the [XSS Filter](https://www.slideshare.net/codeblue_jp/xss-attacks-exploiting-xss-filter-by-masato-kinugawa-code-blue-2015) or [Chrome's XSS Auditor](https://portswigger.net/research/abusing-chromes-xss-auditor-to-steal-tokens). The largest category of those attacks are so-called [Cross-site Leaks](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/new-xs-leak-techniques-reveal-fresh-ways-to-expose-user-information) and [lots of them](https://github.com/xsleaks/xsleaks/wiki/Links) are only possible due to the XSS Filter or the XSS Auditor.

Due to this series of problems and vulnerabilities first Microsoft decided to turn off the XSS Filter in Edge as described in [this blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/07/25/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17723-and-build-18204/#0hOpeoUeI62wJyD1.97) (interestingly, the announcement about new Emojis in the same post gets more than 5 times the screen space). Google first tried to fix some vulnerabilities in Chrome's XSS Auditor by switching the default from blocking (``X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block``) to filtering (``X-XSS-Protection: 1``) and back to blocking, but eventually gave in and [retired the XSS Auditor](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=968591) with version 78. After this, Safari and IE will be the last browsers to support this header.

For further reading on the topic we suggest two excelent articles by the folks from Portswigger:
* [Google deprecates XSS Auditor for Chrome](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-deprecates-xss-auditor-for-chrome)
* [XSS protection disappears from Microsoft Edge](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/xss-protection-disappears-from-microsoft-edge)

### How does the browser react?
When the browser loads a web site and does not receive an ``X-XSS-Protection`` HTTP header, it has to apply a default policy. These are the options:

1. Do not use XSS protection at all, which implies defaulting to ``X-XSS-Protection: 0``. This is what Firefox and Opera have always been doing, what Edge is doing since 2018 and Chrome is doing since version 78. This should be considered the most secure option at the moment.
2. Use XSS protection but in filter mode, which implies defaulting to ``X-XSS-Protection: 1``. This option was chosen by Chrome for a short period of time trying to fix some vulnerabilities. Safari still uses this option.
3. Use XSS protection in block mode, which implies defaulting to ``X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block``. This option was the chosen default for Chrome and Edge for a long time. Currently, only Internet Explorer still uses it.

This testcase tests which browser chooses which of these options.
