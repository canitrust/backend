### Introduction
We generally recommend to set the security header `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` for protections against MIME sniffing and eventually Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
Since it is unclear, when the different browsers perform MIME sniffing, we conducted a test with different `Content-Type` headers in the servers response. 

### Problem
Imagine an application that provides a file upload to its users, e.g. image upload. Additionally, these images can be accessed via a direct link after the upload. If an attacker can upload files, which contain HTML including JavaScript and the application serves these files afterward, it could be possible that the browser is sniffing the content, recognizing the HTML and renders it. Then we have an XSS vulnerability.
This attack only works, if the browser performs MIME sniffing. We want to understand which `Content-Type` headers still cause sniffing and what are the differences between the browsers.
In our responses, we varied different common `Content-Type` header values and some unusual values. The body contained HTML with an XSS payload. If the browser performs MIME sniffing and renders the HTML, the XSS will be exploited.
