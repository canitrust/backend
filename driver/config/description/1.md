### Introduction
The [Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP header, often called HSTS, instructs the browser how SSL/TLS should be handled for this web site, e.g.:
``` 
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```
The above example tells the browser a number of things:
1. This web site must only be called via HTTPS, never via HTTP.
2. If an HTTP connection for this web site is requested, the browser automatically upgrades to HTTPS.
3. This setting will be stored in the browaser for 31536000 seconds or 1 year.
4. This setting is also applied to all subdomains of the current web site.

This header is an important defence against man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker tries to intercept connections before the SSL encryption is active and change HTTPS links to HTTP (so-called [SSL stripping](https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/) attacks).

### Problem
Imagine the server the following ``Strict-Transport-Security`` header when the browser loads a page from ``https://www.canitrust.in``:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
[...]
```
In this example, the server sets an HSTS header for 1 year (31536000 seconds) for ``www.canitrust.in`` but also for subdomains like ``foo.www.canitrust.in``. It should, however, *not* make these settings for other hosts in the same domain like ``bar.canitrust.in`` or even the [apex domain](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/28/to-www-or-not-www/) itself (``canitrust.in``).

### How does the browser react?
When the browser receives such an HSTS header with the ``includeSubDomains`` attribute when loading a web site, it has the following options:

1. Set the HSTS setting for this host and its subhosts. Other hosts on the same level or the apex domain do not get this setting. This is the correct implementation according to the specification.
2. Set the HSTS setting for this host, its subhosts and also for hosts at the same level. The apex domain does not get this setting.
3. Set the HSTS setting for this host, its subhosts and also for teh apex domain. Hosts at the same level do not get this setting.
4. Set the HSTS setting for this host, its subhosts, for hosts at the same level and also for the apex domain.
5. Ignore the ``includeSubDomains`` header and only set the HSTS settings for this host.

This testcase tests which browser chooses which of these options.
