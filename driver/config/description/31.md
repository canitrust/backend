### Introduction
The ``Path`` directive of cookies defines the *scope* of the cookies: what URL path the cookies should be sent to.
The value of the ``Path`` directive specifies a URL path that must exist in the requested URL in order for the browser to send the cookie. For example, if *Path=/path1* is set, then these paths will match and the cookie will be sent:
* /path1
* /path1/subpath
* /path1/subpath/subsubpath

The cookie with *Path=/path1* must not be sent to other paths, eg. */path2*.
### The test
In this testcase, we verify the default behavior of browsers to find out whether or not they handle the cookie's ``Path`` directive correctly.
