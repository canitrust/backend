### Introduction
With the [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) HTTP header a server can give instructions to the browser as to whether the content of this site is allowed to be rendered in a frame or an iframe:
```
X-Frame-Options: deny
```
This header tells the browser to never render the content of this page in a frame or an iframe. Alternatively, the header can also be sent with the ``sameorigin`` value which allows this content only to be loaded from within pages of the same origin. In legacy browsers another value was allowed:
```
X-Frame-Options: allow-from www.canitrust.in
```
This now obsolete directive would allow this content to only be loaded from within ``www.canitrust.in`` and denied from anywhere else.

### Problem
Imagine the following HTML code being sent by the server when requesting ``http://www.canitrust.in``:
```
<html>
  <head>[...]</head>
  <body>
    [...]
    <iframe src="http://foo.canitrust.in/index.html" ></iframe>
    [...]
  </body>
</html
```
Now, the browser automatically sends a request to ``http://foo.canitrust.in/index.html`` to load the iframe and receives the following HTTP header:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
X-Frame-Options: allow-from www.canitrust.in
X-Frame-Options: deny
[...]
```
The two ``X-Frame-Options`` headers in this example contradict each other. The first one allows the content to be loaded in iframes from within ``www.canitrust.in``, but the second one disallows the content to be loaded from any origin.

### How does the browser react?
When the browser receives such contradicting ``X-Frame-Options`` headers when loading the content of an iframe, it has the following options:

1. Only accept the ``X-Frame-Options: deny`` header and disregard the ``allow-from`` value. This is the correct option as the ``allow-from`` directive is obsolete and should be ignored by browsers. Also this option is more secure as it favors the more restrictive header declaration.
2. Only accept the ``X-Frame-Options: allow-from`` header and disregard the ``deny`` value. This is a rather insecure option as it gives precedence to the more permissive header declaration.
3. The browser accepts the first ``X-Frame-Options`` header it receives and disregards any following ones, no matter their values.
4. The browser accepts the last ``X-Frame-Options`` header it receives and disregards any previous ones, no matter their values.

This testcase tests which browser chooses which of these options.
