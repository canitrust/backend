### Introduction
Some time ago, JSON files were treated as valid Javascript sources. This was true at least for some versions of Firefox, as hinted in the following Mozila blog post: [Mozilla Security Blog: Mitigating MIME Confusion Attacks in Firefox 50](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/08/26/mitigating-mime-confusion-attacks-in-firefox/):

```

Valid Content-Types for Scripts:
– “application/javascript”
– “application/x-javascript”
– “application/ecmascript”
– “application/json”			<---
– “text/ecmascript”
– “text/javascript”
– “text/json”			<---
```
### Problem
This behavior of Firefox browser was changed in [Mozilla Firefox 60](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/60) release: 
```

Security
The X-Content-Type-Options header, when set to no-sniff, now follows the specification for JavaScript MIME types. In particular, text/json and application/json are no longer valid values (bug 1431095).
```
### Testcase
This testcase tests which browser/version accepts JSON files (`application/json` and `text/json`) as valid `Content-Type` for Javascript.
