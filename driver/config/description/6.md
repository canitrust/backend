### Introduction
Cookies are key-value pairs which the server can set in the calling browser, like so:
``` 
Set-Cookie: foo=bar; Max-Age=2592000; HttpOnly
```
If a request is made to a server, the browser will automatically send all cookies stored for this [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin). This is particularly usefull for [session management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#cookies) where cookies will be used to store session identifiers (session IDs). This behaviour makes such session cookies highly security relevant.

### Problem
Now imagine that a server sends two ``Set-Cookie`` headers to the browser which contain two different values for the same cookie, e.g.:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
Set-Cookie: foo=value1;
Set-Cookie: foo=value2;
[...]
```
This can happen if two infrastructure components (e.g. application server and web server) both try to control the cookie and pick different values which leads to unpredictable behaviour.

### How does the browser react?
When receiving two contradicting values for the same cookie in separate ``Set-Cookie`` headers, the browser now  has three options:

1. Accept the header which is listed first in the HTTP request and ignore the second.
2. Accept the second header and ignore the first.
3. Ignore the cookie altogether.

This testcase tests which browser chooses which of these options.
